# UniProjectAlgorithms
The project is developed in 4 exercises:
- In the first a dynamic array is created with the related basic functions,then I implemented the MergeSort algorithm using the created data structure.
  Tests have been created to verify the correctness of all functions.
- Dynamic programming.
Given two strings s1 and s2, not necessarily of the same length, determine the minimum number of operations necessary to transform the string s2 into s1
